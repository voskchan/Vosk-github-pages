## CS 499 Capstone


My name is Chance Vosk, I majored in Computer Science at Southern New Hampshire University. This page was built to showcase some of my work that I have created during my time at SNHU. Below are three artifacts that I have enhanced in order to showcase my abilities.

## Software Design and Engineering: Appointment Tracker

The artifact I chose for this category was the Appointment tracker I created in CS 320. This application was originally created to learn JUnit testing and did not have much actual user functionality. The JUnit test were designed to fully cover the code to showcase how they can be used for autometed testing so user functionality was not necessary for the purposes of the assignment.

I chose to enhance this artifact as it allowed me to demonstrate my abilities to create software with user functionality as well as create automated testing for the code to ensure it will stay working throughout future updates. I also chose this for the challenge of updating the application to link an appointment with a contact as well as create a way for a user to interface with the application. 

The improvements I made to this code were:
- Creation of a ServiceDriver class for running application
- User Interface through command application
- Addition of Contact requirement when creating an Appointment
- Additional JUnit tests to further cover edge cases
