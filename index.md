## CS 499 Capstone


My name is Chance Vosk, I majored in Computer Science at Southern New Hampshire University. This page was built to showcase some of my work that I have created during my time at SNHU. Below are three artifacts that I have enhanced in order to showcase my abilities.

## Software Design and Engineering: Appointment Tracker

The artifact I chose for this category was the Appointment tracker I created in CS 320. This application was originally created to learn JUnit testing and did not have much actual user functionality. The JUnit test were designed to fully cover the code to showcase how they can be used for autometed testing so user functionality was not necessary for the purposes of the assignment.

I chose to enhance this artifact as it allowed me to demonstrate my abilities to create software with user functionality as well as create automated testing for the code to ensure it will stay working throughout future updates. I also chose this for the challenge of updating the application to link an appointment with a contact as well as create a way for a user to interface with the application. 

The improvements I made to this code were:
- Creation of a ServiceDriver class for running application
- User Interface through command application
- Addition of Contact requirement when creating an Appointment
- Additional JUnit tests to further cover edge cases

## Algorithms and Data Structure: File Encryption

The artifact I chose for this category was my work in file encryption in CS 405. The original creation of this application took an input file and then, using a hardcoded password, performed an XOR cipher on the file. It then output the file as two seperate files, one encrypted and the other decrypted from running the XOR xipher again. I chose this artifact as it showcases my ability to create secure code and create a more secure cipher.

The original creation of this code was missing checks to ensure there was an actual input file. It also used a hard coded password. In longer messages with an XOR cipher this can result in a potential pattern that can be broken. The enhancements I made to this artifact are:
- File checks in order to prevent crashes
- Randomized key generation for cipher
- Key generation to the length of text to prevent pattern breaking
- Addition of a new seperate key file to track generated key

## Databases: CS 340 Grazioso Salvare

The artifact I chose for this category was my work in CS 340. In the original creation of this work I created a website linked to a database. This database was used to display animals in shelters that could be potential candidates for the company to use for rescue operations. I chose to use this as my artifact as it would showcase my ability to create a databse as well as link this database to a program to display information.

As the original creation of this work was made in the apporto virtual lab the code was created to run on a linux based enviroment. The main problem I had to overcome with this project was recreating the project within a windows enviroment and running the project. The other problem I encountered was that I no longer had access to the database that the work pulled from
